# Variables for Analysis
Link these to each research question or hypothesis to be tested.

## Dependent Variables

| Variable         | Level        | Description                           | Type                  | Source               |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Primary Outcome | Patient-level | FACT-leukemia Quality of Life | Quantitative score (0-100) | 12-month REDCap survey |

## Independent Variables

| Variable  | Level   | Description                           | Type   | Source                         |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Treatment | Practice | Study arm randomized at practice level | Binary | Study statistician |

# Data Analysis
Some general analytic approaches (expand and modify as needed).

## Setting and Subjects
1. Generate frequency distributions and summary statistics.  
2. Examine distributions to determine normality.  
3. Compare sample characteristics to the target population.  
4. Address dropouts and refusals using statistical tests.  

## Bivariate Analysis
Compare parametric and non-parametric statistics.  

## Multivariable Analysis
- Choice of model (e.g., logistic regression, linear regression, survival analysis).  
- Strategy for covariate selection.  
- Model validation strategies.  

# Tables and Figures
- **Table 1:** Demographics by treatment group.  
- **Table 2:** Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression coefficients.  
- **Supplementary Table 1:** Comparison of patients who completed follow-up vs. those who did not.
