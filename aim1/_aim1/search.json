    "text": "Preface\nThis is a Quarto book for 2025 SCOPE DCC project.\nA Visual Tool to Help Develop a Statistical Analysis Plan for Randomized Trials in Palliative Care\nCollaboration with a statistician about the design of a statistical analysis plan can be enhanced by illustrating how statisticians conceptualize their task. This conceptualization can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which illustrates the statistician’s approach and also provides an actionable tool to assist in the development of the plan.\nCollaboration with a statistician can be enhanced by understanding how they conceptualize questions of study design and data analysis. In the language of constructivism: by explicitly encountering their “mental maps” of these topics. One such mental map pertains to the development of a statistical analysis plan (SAP), an outline of which is one of each team’s work products. Here, we use a figure to describe how statisticians typically conceptualize SAPs, and then illustrate how this figure can be used to develop an outline of a generic SAP for a randomized trial of a pain coping intervention in palliative care. It is our hope that making this conceptual framework explicit can help support more productive interactions between palliative care researchers and statisticians.\nThe main documents are stored in this link"

    "text": "3.1 HYPOTHESES\n\nAim 1: To determine whether primary palliative care (PC) is non-inferior to specialty PC for improving quality of life (QOL) in patients with AML\nH1.1 (ITT): Primary palliative care (PC) is non-inferior to specialty PC in improving quality of life (QOL) for patients with AML (with non-inferiority margin: 5.0 points on the FACT-Leukemia scale). The primary endpoint comparison will be at week 12 - minimal cross-contamination between study groups in the cluster-randomized design. The ITT approach preserves the advantage of randomization, ensuring that all enrolled patients are analyzed in their assigned treatment group, minimizing selection bias.\nH1.2 (PP): The per-protocol analysis, adjusting for non-adherence using inverse probability weighting (IPW), will confirm that primary PC remains non-inferior to specialty PC in improving QOL and secondary outcomes among patients who adhered to their assigned treatment model with linear mixed model (LMM) assessed at week 12.\nH1.3 (HTE): The impact of primary PC vs. specialty PC on QOL and secondary outcomes may differ based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, AML diagnosis (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory), and enrollment of caregiver using interaction terms in the mixed models."

This would be a good place to mention specific analyses (e.g. multivariable linear regression, etc) and highlight pros and cons or issues that need to be addressed\nH1: The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis serves as the primary approach to evaluating whether primary palliative care (PC) is non-inferior to specialty PC in improving quality of life (QOL) in patients with AML. The primary outcome, measured using FACT-Leukemia scores at week 12, will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to account for repeated measurements and clustering within study sites. Fixed effects in the model will include treatment group, time, demographic covariates (age, gender, race/ethnicity), and clinical covariates (AML diagnosis type and leukemia risk level) to control for potential confounders. Given the non-inferiority margin of 5.0 points, the ITT approach ensures that all randomized patients remain in their assigned treatment groups, regardless of adherence, thereby preserving the benefits of randomization and reducing selection bias. This strategy enhances the generalizability of findings while minimizing potential distortions caused by deviations from the assigned intervention.\nModel Building for H1:\n\nUse a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) with lme4::lmer() or nlme::lme() : -Random intercepts for site clusters to account for cluster-randomization. -Fixed effects for treatment group, baseline QOL, and other covariates (as sensitivity). -Estimate mean difference in QOL between arms at 12 weeks. -Assess non-inferiority by testing if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment effect is above -5.0 points. -Software: R lme4 for mixed models, emmeans for post-hoc contrasts. -Sensitivity: nlme, lmerTest, or geepack for robustness checks.\n\nH2. To complement the ITT approach, a per-protocol (PP) analysis will be conducted using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for treatment non-adherence. This analysis will provide insight into the effectiveness of primary PC among patients who adhered to their assigned intervention, addressing potential biases introduced by crossover or deviations from protocol. IPW weights will be computed based on key demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, AML diagnosis, leukemia risk, and institutional factors, to balance the comparison groups more accurately. Sensitivity analyses will be performed by excluding patients with extreme weights to ensure robustness. The comparison of ITT and PP results will serve as a critical validation step, allowing for the assessment of potential treatment effects that may be masked in the ITT framework due to non-adherence.\nH3. The heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) analysis will explore whether the impact of primary PC varies across key patient subgroups. This analysis will focus on both primary and secondary outcomes, including QOL (FACT-Leukemia), psychological distress (HADS-Depression, HADS-Anxiety), PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist), symptom burden (ESAS-r), and patient perception of care (PPPC). Likelihood ratio tests will be used to compare models with and without interaction terms for age, gender, race/ethnicity, AML diagnosis (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory), and caregiver enrollment, helping to determine whether treatment effects differ significantly across these subgroups. Identifying treatment effect heterogeneity will enhance the ability to personalize palliative care approaches, ensuring that interventions are optimized for different patient populations."

The impact of non-adherence on the primary outcome will be assessed via sensitivity analyses comparing ITT and per-protocol results.\nIn the protocol, adherence is mentioned as staying within the assigned palliative care (PC) model: “We will also assess for potential factors that are associated with non-adherence to the assigned PC model such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, time from diagnosis, underlying leukemia diagnosis, leukemia risk, and institutional factors that might be associated with non-adherence (leukemia volume, size of leukemia program, and other institutional supportive care initiatives).”​\nPatients receiving palliative care from the assigned model (Primary PC or Specialty PC). No cross-contamination (i.e., patients in Primary PC receiving Specialty PC services or vice versa).\n\n19.1.1 Adherence measurements\nReceiving at least 2 visits per week from the assigned PC team (as mentioned elsewhere in intervention delivery expectations).\nNo crossover documented in intervention fidelity tracking."

    "text": "21.1 Safety\nParticipant safety will be overseen by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) composed of three members with expertise in palliative care clinical trials, biostatistics, and clinical trial ethics. Safety information, including serious adverse events potentially related to study procedures, non-serious adverse events, recruitment and retention rates, and data quality metrics, will be reviewed annually in unblinded reports prepared by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The DSMB has the authority to recommend study termination if participant risks outweigh potential benefits; however, no formal statistical stopping boundary has been prespecified. Study conduct and data quality reports will ensure continuous monitoring to safeguard participants and preserve trial integrity."
