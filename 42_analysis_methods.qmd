## Tests for Heterogeneity {#sec-heterogeneity}

We will analyze HTE by testing for interaction effects between the two groups and the following variables: patient age (> 65 vs. < 65), gender (male vs. female), race/ethnicity (White vs. other; White vs. Black; White vs. Asian; Non-Hispanic white vs. Hispanic/Latino), AML diagnosis (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory AML), and enrollment of caregiver (yes vs. no). The interaction terms will be tested in the linear and logistic mixed effect models.. All HTE analyses are considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Prior studies have found that age, gender, and race can moderate the impact of specialty PC in patients with cancer. However, it remains unclear whether these factors would contribute to HTE of primary PC versus specialty PC. Lastly, since caregiver engagement may impact patient-outcomes, we will examine whether enrollment of a caregiver contributes to the HTE of specialty PC compared to primary PC. We chose to be conservative with our sample size estimate to account for HTE analyses for the primary endpoint of the study. 

## Adjustment for a Moderate Number of Clusters {#sec-cluster}

Although generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) have been shown to produce robust inference for cluster randomized trials with at least 10 clusters, sensitivity analyses using an appropriate small-sample adjustment will be carried out for all primary and secondary outcomes [@Leyrat2018].
