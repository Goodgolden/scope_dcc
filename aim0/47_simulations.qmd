If conducting a simulation, a description of the purpose of the simulation and its design (e.g. fully factorial, partially factorial, grid search, etc.)

Define the fixed and variable factors or parameters in the simulation, the estimands/targets of the simulation, and the performance measures to be estimated (with justifications of their relevance to the estimands/targets)

Description of the tabular and graphical presentations of simulation results and their
interpretation
