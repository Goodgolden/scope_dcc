## PATIENT COHORT AND SUBJECTS {#sec-cohort}

Describe the patients who are part of this manuscript. Specify inclusion and exclusion criteria and study site(s).

### Inclusion Criteria

Hospitalized patients (age > 18 years) with high-risk AML, defined as one of the following:
-	Patients with new diagnosis > 60 years of age.
-	An antecedent hematologic disorder.
-	Therapy-related AML.
-	Relapsed or primary refractory AML.
Receiving treatment with one of the following:
-	Intensive chemotherapy (7+3 regimen or a modification on a clinical trial, or a similar intensive regimen requiring prolonged hospitalization).
-	Hypomethylating agents ¬± additional agents or modifications on a clinical trial

### Exclusion Criteria 

-	Patients with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
-	Patients with AML receiving supportive care alone.
-	Patients with psychiatric or cognitive conditions that the treating clinician believes prohibits informed consent or compliance with study procedures.
-	Patients seen by a palliative care clinician (MD, DO, or APP) during two previous hospitalizations in the six months prior to enrollment.

### Study Site(s) 
The study is being conducted across 20 sites. These sites were selected through The Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC), ensuring that each site has a medium to large leukemia practice and an inpatient specialty palliative care (PC) practice. Key criteria for site selection:

-	Each site was required to see at least 50 new AML patients per year.
-	Sites needed infrastructure to conduct the study, including access to inpatient specialty PC practice to accommodate patients randomized to specialty PC.
-	Prior interviews were conducted with 35 potential sites, and the final 20 were selected based on their ability to conduct the study.
Primary Coordinating Center: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) serves as the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for the trial.
