## Study Timelines {#sec-timeline}

Patients and their caregivers will remain on study until the patientâ€™s death or up to 5 years after enrollment. 
The funding agency requires that we conduct this study in two phases, designated phase 1 and phase 2. Phase 1 will be conducted during the first 18 months and phase 2 will be conducted during the final five years of the 78-month study period.

During phase 1, we will complete study training, institute the study protocol, and enroll approximately 40 patients and 20 caregivers at four of the 20 participating sites. The four sites participating in phase 1 will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to specialty PC versus primary PC without any stratification. At the end of the 18-month study period, we will conduct study training and institute the study protocol at the other 16 sites. During phase 2, the 16 sites will be randomized to specialty PC versus primary PC stratified by percent minority population to ensure a balanced proportion of minority participants across the arms. During the remainder of the study period, we will enroll additional patients to achieve our study enrollment goal of 1150 patients. Table 2 @tab-table2 depicts the study timeline and procedures:
