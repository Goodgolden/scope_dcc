    "title": "\n9  Background\n",
    "section": "\n9.1 Scientific Background",
    "text": "9.1 Scientific Background\n\n9.1.1 Patients with AML have a sudden life-threatening illness requiring urgent therapy\nAML is an aggressive disease, characterized by an abrupt onset, an urgent need to initiate treatment, and a poor prognosis with 80% risk of death at five years (Alibhai et al. 2007, 2015; Burnett et al. 2010; Walter and Estey 2020; Vey 2020). Most patients with AML are treated with chemotherapy drugs that require hospitalization due to significant toxicities and potentially life-threatening complications, such as bleeding and sepsis (Rodin et al. 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2013; Zittoun, Achard, and Ruszniewski 1999; A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015a). Patients with AML often present to medical attention without prodromal symptoms, so they are quite shocked to learn that they have a life-threatening illness and must be immediately hospitalized to receive intensive chemotherapy (Alibhai et al. 2007, 2015; Burnett et al. 2010).\n\n9.1.2 Patients with AML face substantial physical and psychological symptoms\nDuring their hospitalization for chemotherapy, patients with AML often experience difficult physical symptoms, including fevers, fatigue, pain, insomnia, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that negatively impact their quality of life (QOL) and physical function (Rodin et al. 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2013; Zittoun, Achard, and Ruszniewski 1999; A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015a; A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019; Loh et al. 2019; Wiese and Daver 2018). Psychological symptoms are also quite prominent in these patients, with over one-third experiencing acute stress reactions from the shock of their diagnosis and need for urgent hospitalization (Rodin et al. 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2013; Zittoun, Achard, and Ruszniewski 1999; A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015a; A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019; Loh et al. 2019; Wiese and Daver 2018; Nissim et al. 2013, 2014; Papadopoulou, Johnston, and Themessl-Huber 2013; Farsi, Nayeri, and Negarandeh 2012; Gheihman et al. 2015; V. Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015; Vida Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015). Notably, the psychological burden during this hospitalization also impacts patients’ long-term QOL, mood, and adaptation to their illness (V. Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015; Vida Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015). Up to 40% of patients with AML suffer from post-traumatic stress symptoms due to the trauma of their diagnosis (Smith et al. 1999; Jacobsen et al. 1998, 2002; Mundy et al. 2000).Therefore, addressing the physical and psychological needs of hospitalized patients with AML has the potential to improve their outcomes significantly both during their hospitalization and in the long-term.\n\n9.1.3 Patients with AML face difficult decisions about treatment\nMany treatments are available that offer a chance of cure for patients with AML, including stem cell transplant. However, the chance of cure is small and most patients with AML unfortunately die of their illness (Schlenk et al. 2017; Ganzel et al. 2018). Consequently, to make informed decisions about whether to receive additional treatment, patients with AML must understand their prognosis and likelihood of cure (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020, 2018). Unfortunately, data suggest that 90% of patients with AML report overly optimistic estimates of their prognosis (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2018). Thus, they are unprepared to make difficult decisions that require them to balance the risks and benefits of treatments that offer an uncertain chance of cure, but will worsen their QOL and require them to spend additional time in the hospital (A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015a). Therefore, patients with AML face considerable uncertainty and often misunderstand their prognosis, limiting their ability to make informed decisions about treatment.\n\n9.1.4 Patients with AML rarely discuss their end-of-life (EOL) care preferences\nDue to the chance of cure even after multiple therapies, oncology clinicians often defer engaging in conversations with patients with AML about their EOL care preferences (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020). As the majority of these patients die, it is imperative that oncology clinicians elicit their goals and help them make decisions about their EOL care. Unfortunately, studies show that patients with AML do not engage in timely discussions with their clinicians about their care preferences and consequently receive aggressive care at the EOL (V. Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015; A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015b; T. W. LeBlanc and Erba 2019; T. W. LeBlanc, Egan, and Olszewski 2018; D. Hui et al. 2014; A. A. El-Jawahri et al. 2015; A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Bosshard et al. 2018; Klepin, Rao, and Pardee 2014). Specifically, while many patients with cancer express a preference to die at home and minimize time in the hospital, 80% of patients with AML are hospitalized in the last month of life, with 50% dying in the hospital. Over half receive chemotherapy in the last month of life and 30% die in the intensive care unit (ICU) (V. Ghodraty-Jabloo et al. 2015; A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015b; T. W. LeBlanc and Erba 2019; T. W. LeBlanc, Egan, and Olszewski 2018; D. Hui et al. 2014; A. A. El-Jawahri et al. 2015; A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Bosshard et al. 2018; Klepin, Rao, and Pardee 2014). Evidence-based interventions are needed to enhance patient–clinician communication and optimize EOL care for patients with AML.\n\n9.1.5 Caregivers of patients with AML experience tremendous burden and distress\nThe family and close friends (“caregivers”) of patients with AML play a critical role in their care, but also experience distress as they face the shock of the patient’s diagnosis and cope with uncertainty (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2015; Gemmill et al. 2011; Fife et al. 2009). During the patient’s hospitalization for treatment, caregivers report a marked decline in their QOL and mood as they witness the patient struggle with side effects (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019). After the patient is discharged from the hospital, the caregiver helps manage the patient’s symptoms, attends multiple oncology appointments, coordinates medical care, and prepares for subsequent hospitalizations (Grover et al. 2019). Caregivers experience the highest burden and psychological distress when caring for patients with AML near the EOL (Grover et al. 2019; Gerlach, Alt-Epping, and Oechsle 2019). Not surprisingly, caregivers of patients with AML have disruptions in their professional and personal lives. Thus, caregivers of patients with AML would benefit from support as they navigate the patient’s illness.\n\n9.1.6 Specialty palliative care improves outcomes for patients and their caregivers\nA growing body of evidence has demonstrated the essential role of specialty palliative care (PC) clinicians in the care of patients with advanced solid tumors (Temel et al. 2010, 2017; M. Bakitas et al. 2009; M. A. Bakitas et al. 2015; Zimmermann et al. 2014). Integrating PC with oncology care from the time of diagnosis for patients with advanced solid tumors improves patients’ QOL, psychological health, and EOL care (Temel et al. 2010, 2017; M. Bakitas et al. 2009; M. A. Bakitas et al. 2015; Zimmermann et al. 2014). Emerging data have similarly shown the benefits of specialty PC for patients with hematologic malignancies (Areej R. El-Jawahri et al. 2016, 2017; Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). We recently completed a multi-site randomized trial of specialty PC versus usual care in hospitalized patients with AML (Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Patients assigned to specialty PC met with a PC clinician at least twice weekly during their hospitalization for chemotherapy and subsequent hospitalizations up to one year. Specialty PC improved patients’ QOL, depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms (Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Importantly, specialty PC led to clinically meaningful and sustained improvements in patients’ QOL and psychological distress for six months after initiating chemotherapy (Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Patients receiving specialty PC were also more likely to discuss their EOL care preferences and less likely to receive chemotherapy in the last month of life (Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Thus, involvement of specialty PC improves the experience and outcomes of patients with serious cancer and their caregivers.\n\n9.1.7 Specialty PC is not an accessible or scalable care model\nDespite the benefits of specialty PC for patients with cancer, it is not feasible to provide this care for all patients given the limited availability of trained PC clinicians (David Hui et al. 2010; Lupu, Hospice, and Force 2010; Blackhall et al. 2016). Nearly half of National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers do not have the specialty PC workforce to provide care for their patients with cancer (David Hui et al. 2010; Lupu, Hospice, and Force 2010; Blackhall et al. 2016). Due to these workforce shortages, most specialty PC is triaged to provide care for patients with incurable cancer at the EOL. Thus, despite the growing evidence base, substantial challenges limit the scalability and dissemination of this care model, especially in caring for patients with hematologic malignancies (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Thomas W. LeBlanc and El-Jawahri 2015). Moreover, oncology clinicians caring for patients with hematologic malignancies rarely consult specialty PC as they view providing PC within their scope of practice (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Thomas W. LeBlanc and El-Jawahri 2018; Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2018; David Hui et al. 2015). Furthermore, given the complex chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with AML and their side effects, oncology clinicians may be the ideal clinicians to address these needs (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Thomas W. LeBlanc and El-Jawahri 2018; Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2018; David Hui et al. 2015).\n\n9.1.8 Primary PC may be an alternative care model to specialty PC\nTraining oncology clinicians to incorporate PC skills into their care practice (i.e., “primary PC”) is an alternative strategy to having specialty trained PC clinicians care for all patients with cancer. Recent studies have shown that primary PC interventions in which oncology clinicians are trained to address patient’s symptoms and engage in serious illness conversations are feasible, acceptable, and improve patient outcomes (Bernacki et al. 2019; Paladino et al. 2019). These interventions have been shown to increase oncology clinicians’ knowledge about symptom assessment and management, as well as their comfort managing psychological distress (Epstein et al. 2017; Reddy et al. 2019; Schenker et al. 2015). In a cluster randomized trial in which oncology clinicians were trained in serious illness communication, patients receiving primary PC were more likely to have documented EOL discussions and reported lower anxiety and depression symptoms (Bernacki et al. 2019; Paladino et al. 2019). While these primary PC studies are promising, it remains unknown how primary PC compares with specialty PC for improving QOL and EOL care for patients with cancer (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Kavalieratos et al. 2016). Recent systematic reviews highlight the need for comparative effectiveness trials of primary versus specialty PC, to determine how to best meet the needs of patients with serious cancers, and especially those with hematologic malignancies (A. El-Jawahri et al. 2020; Kavalieratos et al. 2016)."

    "text": "9.2 Resources Available\n\n9.2.1 Team Qualifications and Oversight\nDue to the size and scope of this award, we have chosen a leadership plan with dual study PIs (Drs. Areej El-Jawahri and Jennifer Temel). The dual PIs have a long-standing history of collaboration with over 20 funded research projects, and led the specialty PC trial in leukemia, which serves as the preliminary data for the current project. The dual PIs pre-existing relationship, including a history of successful collaborations on grant applications and manuscripts in high tier medical journals, and complimentary experience conducing PC trials, will ensure they provide effective leadership of this study. The University of Colorado Data, Informatics, and Statistics Core will serve as the DCC. Dr. Colborn will provide independent leadership of the DCC and have autonomy over data integrity, data quality, and data analysis during both the study phases.. Prior studies have highlighted the unique challenges of conducting PC research trials with adequate methodological oversight and appropriate data analytical approach. Specifically, given their experience with PC research methodology, our DCC possess the necessary expertise to: - 1) ensure adequate oversight of data collection procedures for participant-reported outcomes - 2) address challenges of attrition and missing data due to death in PC research - 3) implement statistical methods to address missing data - 4) measure PC intervention fidelity. Furthermore, the DCC investigative team has substantial expertise in serving as the DCC for multiple large-scale multi-site projects.\n\n9.2.2 Other Resources\nWe solicited participating sites through The Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) with medium to large leukemia practices to ensure that each site would see a minimum of 50 new patients with AML per year. We also chose sites that have an inpatient specialty PC practice to accommodate patients who are randomized to receiving specialty PC. Prior to submitting this project, we conducted interviews with 35 sites and chose 20 sites with appropriate infrastructure to conduct the study. As many of these sites are tertiary care centers, we estimate that 15% of new patients will be second-opinion consultations only and therefore ineligible. We estimate that each site will have a minimum of 40 eligible patients per year. At MGH, we have enrolled 70% of eligible patients with AML in our prior PC trials. Since the proposed study is a cluster randomized trial, we anticipate that enrollment rates will be higher than prior studies, as patients are not being randomized. Nonetheless, we conservatively estimate that at least 60% of eligible patients will enroll in the study. In our prior studies, 60% of patients who enrolled had a caregiver who was willing to participate, so we conservatively estimate caregiver enrollment rates of approximately 50%. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to achieve our proposed enrollment goals for patients and caregivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlibhai, S. M., H. Breunis, N.

    "text": "10.1 Preliminary Data\nList of all outcome/endpoint variables, with a description of their coding/units, timing, and source, corresponding to the statistical hypotheses. If any variables are defined using ICD or CPT codes, list them out.\n\n10.1.1 Burden of AML\nWe demonstrated that patients with AML have a marked decline in their quality of life (QOL) during chemotherapy [B = -9.5, P < 0.001] and that the proportion with clinically significant depression increases during the first month after treatment (34% to 46%, P = 0.01)(A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019). Caregivers similarly experience a deterioration in their QOL and the proportion with clinically significant depression almost doubles in the first month after treatment (17% to 31%, P = 0.03)(A. El-Jawahri et al. 2019). We have also shown that patients with AML spend two-thirds of their life from diagnosis to death in the hospital or clinic, and in the last month of life almost 90% are hospitalized, half receive chemotherapy, and one-third are admitted to the ICU (A. R. El-Jawahri et al. 2015).\n\n10.1.2 Specialty PC\nThe MGH research team has conducted six multi-site specialty PC trials in patients with cancer. In their landmark New England Journal of Medicine study, they showed that patients with advanced lung cancer assigned to specialty PC from the time of diagnosis had better QOL, less depression, higher rates of documented end-of-life (EOL) care preferences, lower rates of chemotherapy administration in the last month of life, and increased hospice utilization compared to patients receiving usual care (J. S. Temel et al. 2010). These findings were confirmed in a subsequent large-scale trial in patients with advanced lung and gastrointestinal cancers (Jerome S. Temel et al. 2016). Based on this work, specialty PC has become standard of care for patients with advanced solid tumors (Ferrell et al. 2016).\nRecognizing that specialty PC was rarely involved in the care of patients with hematologic malignancies, we studied the first specialty PC intervention for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing stem cell transplantation. This trial demonstrated that specialty PC improved key patient outcomes—including QOL, depression, and anxiety (tab-outcomes?; Areej R. El-Jawahri et al. 2016, 2017)—and caregiver depression and coping (Areej R. El-Jawahri et al. 2016, 2017). These benefits were sustained at 12- and 24-weeks post-transplant with improvements in patient depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Areej R. El-Jawahri et al. 2016, 2017). Building on this work, we recently completed a multi-site randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of specialty PC for patients with AML. This study demonstrated early and sustained improvement in patients’ QOL, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (tab-outcomes?; Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Patients receiving specialty PC were also significantly more likely to discuss their EOL care preferences with their clinicians and less likely to receive chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life (Areej El-Jawahri et al. 2021). Thus, the MGH team has substantial experience conducting large-scale PC trials in oncology that will ensure the success of this project.\n\n10.1.3 Primary PC\nOur investigative team also has experience training clinicians to deliver primary PC. Dr. Yael Schenker conducted a single-arm pilot trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of primary PC for patients with advanced cancer (Schenker et al. 2015). The primary PC intervention entailed training oncology clinicians to address symptoms, engage patients and caregivers in EOL discussions, provide emotional support, and coordinate care, especially at the EOL. All eligible oncology clinicians attended the training and felt it improved the quality of care they provided for patients with advanced cancer. Patients and caregivers reported high satisfaction with primary PC and perceived it as helpful in addressing symptoms, coping, and planning for the future (Schenker et al. 2015). Additionally, Dr. Vicki Jackson has expertise conducting primary PC training for clinicians in oncology and other medical specialties through her leadership of the Harvard Palliative Care Education and Practice course. More than 1200 clinicians have attended this course on the management of physical and psychological symptoms, coping, illness understanding, and EOL communication. Thus, our research team has the necessary expertise to train oncology clinicians successfully to deliver PC and evaluate the effectiveness of primary PC for patients with cancer.\n\n10.1.4 Table Patient Outcomes with Specialty PC\n\nCodeknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/F22_table1_outcomes.png\",\n                        dpi = 30,)\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand Table 1\nTable 1: Patient Outcomes with Specialty PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trial\nIntervention Effect (B)\n95% CI\nP-value\n\n\n\nSpecialty PC in Stem Cell Transplant\n\n\n\n\n\nQOL at 2 weeks\n7.73\n1.27, 14.19\n0.019\n\n\nAnxiety at 2 weeks\n-2.25\n-3.22, -1.29\n<0.001\n\n\nDepression at 2 weeks\n-1.74\n-3.01, -0.47\n0.007\n\n\nQOL at 12 weeks\n5.34\n0.04, 10.64\n0.048\n\n\nDepression at 12 weeks\n-1.70\n-2.75, -0.65\n0.002\n\n\nPTSD at 12 weeks\n-4.34\n-7.12, -1.57\n0.002\n\n\nSpecialty PC in AML\n\n\n\n\n\nQOL at 2 weeks\n8.85\n0.43, 17.28\n0.039\n\n\nAnxiety at 2 weeks\n-1.41\n-2.56, -0.25\n0.017\n\n\nDepression at 2 weeks\n-1.51\n-2.80, -0.23\n0.021\n\n\nQOL at 12 weeks\n11.11\n3.15, 19.06\n0.007\n\n\nDepression at 12 weeks\n-2.22\n-3.59, -0.85\n0.002\n\n\nAnxiety at 12 weeks\n-1.59\n-2.85, -0.33\n0.013\n\n\nPTSD at 12 weeks\n-3.91\n-6.67, -1.16\n0.006\n\n\n\nCode\\begin{table}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Table 1: Patient Outcomes with Specialty PC}\n  \\begin{tabular}{@{} l c c c @{}}\n    \\toprule\n    \\textbf{Clinical Trial} & \\textbf{Intervention Effect (B)} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} & \\textbf{P-value} \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\textbf{Specialty PC in Stem Cell Transplant} &  &  &  \\\\\n    QOL at 2 weeks & 7.73 & 1.27, 14.19 & 0.019 \\\\\n    Anxiety at 2 weeks & -2.25 & -3.22, -1.29 & $<$0.001 \\\\\n    Depression at 2 weeks & -1.74 & -3.01, -0.47 & 0.007 \\\\\n    QOL at 12 weeks & 5.34 & 0.04, 10.64 & 0.048 \\\\\n    Depression at 12 weeks & -1.70 & -2.75, -0.65 & 0.002 \\\\\n    PTSD at 12 weeks & -4.34 & -7.12, -1.57 & 0.002 \\\\\n    \\addlinespace\n    \\textbf{Specialty PC in AML} &  &  &  \\\\\n    QOL at 2 weeks & 8.85 & 0.43, 17.28 & 0.039 \\\\\n    Anxiety at 2 weeks & -1.41 & -2.56, -0.25 & 0.017 \\\\\n    Depression at 2 weeks & -1.51 & -2.80, -0.23 & 0.021 \\\\\n    QOL at 12 weeks & 11.11 & 3.15, 19.06 & 0.007 \\\\\n    Depression at 12 weeks & -2.22 & -3.59, -0.85 & 0.002 \\\\\n    Anxiety at 12 weeks & -1.59 & -2.85, -0.33 & 0.013 \\\\\n    PTSD at 12 weeks & -3.91 & -6.67, -1.16 & 0.006 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}"

    "text": "12.1 Recruitment Methods\n\n12.1.1 Study-Wide Number of Subjects\nThe study sample will include 1150 patients with AML and up to 1150 caregivers. Patients can participate in the study without a caregiver, and we estimate that approximately 50% of patients will have a caregiver participate in the study. Thus, we anticipate the caregiver sample will be approximately 575 participants. Repeated information\n\n12.1.2 Study-Wide Recruitment Methods\nPrior to the study start, the site investigators will meet with the leukemia clinicians to review recruitment and enrollment procedures.\nThe CRC will communicate with the leukemia clinicians (the physicians and advanced practice providers who care for the patient in the outpatient setting or during their hospitalization) via email, electronic communication through the health record, or verbally to notify them that the patient is eligible for the study and inquire about concerns regarding their participation. If the clinicians have objections to the patient participation in the study, the CRC will document the reason and not approach those individuals. If the leukemia clinicians have no objections, the CRC will approach patients for study participation within three business days of initiating therapy and inform them that their clinicians have agreed for them to be contacted for the study and review the consent document which details the nature of all study procedures. We have separate consent forms for sites randomized to specialty PC or primary PC. The CRC will obtain written informed consent from the patient and provide them with a copy of the signed consent form.\nStudy participants will complete baseline self-report assessments at the time of providing informed consent for the study. If a patient signs the consent form but does not complete the baseline assessment within two business days, they will not be registered on the study and will not count towards accrual numbers. To ensure adequate sample size, we will enroll additional participants for any participants who withdraw, or transfer care within the first 30 days of enrollment. We will increase the total accrual goal within each cluster to account for patients who withdraw, or transfer care within 30 days of the study period.\nPatients who agree to participate in the study will be asked to identify a caregiver who might be interested in participating. Patients without a willing or interested caregiver will still be eligible to participate in the study. The caregiver will be eligible to enroll in the study either at the same time as the patient or within three business days after the patient provides written informed consent. We have separate consent forms for caregivers at sites randomized to specialty PC or primary PC. Caregivers can enroll in the study in-person with a written informed consent or over the telephone with a verbal consent. Caregivers will complete baseline self-report assessments (in-person, over telephone, or via email) on the same day as providing informed consent or within a one-week window. If a caregiver provides consent but does not complete the baseline assessment, they will not be included as study participants.\nPatients and caregivers who speak other languages will have all study procedures and information regarding risks, benefits and study contacts explained to them orally via the use of an interpreter as a first preference or family member as a second preference. Patients who speak other languages will be given the full consent form in their respective language for signing. The consent form will be signed by the participant, and by a witness. The witness will be either an interpreter or a family member. Potentially eligible caregivers will either provide written informed consent or over the telephone with a verbal consent with the assistance of an interpreter (or family member if interpreter is unavailable).\nWe will also recruit key informants for the qualitative portion of this study. Specifically, we will conduct qualitative interviews stratified by the size of the leukemia program at participating sites. For each key informant group, we will interview 30 individuals, consisting of 10 from each size stratum (small, medium, or large leukemia program). Specifically, we will conduct interviews with:\n\n\npatients with AML receiving specialty PC and caregivers;\n\n\npatients with AML receiving primary PC and caregivers;\n\n\noncology clinicians;\n\n\nPC clinicians;\n\n\nhospital leaders to identify facilitators and barriers to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of primary PC and specialty PC.\n\n\nKey informants will provide written or verbal consent over the telephone (given the COVID-19 pandemic).\nAll study participants (patients, caregivers, and key informants) will be provided a copy of their respective consent forms.\nWe are requesting a Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent This Waiver is being requested to assist with caregiver and key informant recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study meets the waiver requirements given our study is considered minimal risk and all study procedures could be conveyed orally. This waiver will reduce the risk to caregivers and key informants and is necessary for our research procedures to continue.\nWe are requesting a HIPAA Waiver of Authorization to Review Preparatory to Research from the IRB. We are requesting this Waiver to identify potential patient participants from a minimal chart review. In accordance with the DF/HCC policy, this Waiver: - (1) is being sought solely to review Protected Health Information as necessary to prepare a research protocol - (2) will not include removing Protected Health Information from the Covered Entity by the researcher - (3) the Protected Health Information for which we are requesting access is necessary for the research purposes\nDF/HCC institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) Oncore as required by DF/HCC SOP REGIST-101.\nFor registration of patients from DF/HCC institutions, study staff will complete the protocol-specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment documented in the participant’s medical record and/or research chart. Study staff will confirm that the participant meets all inclusion criteria as described in this protocol and the criteria on the eligibility checklist.\nPatients from other investigative sites will be entered on the study centrally by MGH study staff. Study staff from the participating institution will confirm eligibility criteria and fax or email the following documents to study staff at MGH: deidentified signed consent form/s, copy of baseline assessment, and a completed eligibility checklist. MGH study staff will follow DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) and register the participant on the protocol. MGH study staff may also call the study staff at the participating site to verbally confirm registration."

    "section": "\n16.1 Aims and Hypotheses",
    "text": "16.1 Aims and Hypotheses\nList of all scientific aims/objectives of the study, with specifications of primary, secondary, etc.\nList of all statistical hypotheses (corresponding to the scientific aims), with specifications of primary, secondary,\n\n16.1.1 Aim 1\nTo determine whether primary PC is non-inferior to specialty PC for improving QOL in patients with AML: We will begin with descriptive and graphical summaries of the endpoints to evaluate whether regression modeling assumptions are met and/or whether there are outliers that might be data entry errors. We will use an intention-to-treat approach for treatment group comparisons and report results using the CONSORT extension to cluster randomized trials. We chose an intention-to-treat approach for the primary analysis in our study as it 1) preserves the advantage of randomization and 2) we anticipate minimal cross-contamination in this cluster randomized clinical trial between study groups, which further enhances the fidelity of an intention-to-treat analysis. Nonetheless, we will closely track the extent of contamination in both study groups. We will also assess for potential factors that are associated with non-adherence to the assigned PC model such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, time from diagnosis, underlying leukemia diagnosis, leukemia risk, and institutional factors that might be associated with non-adherence (leukemia volume, size of leukemia program, and other institutional supportive care initiatives). We will also conduct and report per protocol analyses using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to provide robust statistical estimates for the primary and secondary outcomes in this trial. As the goal of the proposed study is to establish that patient-reported QOL with primary PC is non-inferior to specialty PC, all statistical tests for non-inferiority will be one-sided with an alpha level of 0.025. The primary endpoint of the study is to compare patient QOL (FACT-Leukemia) scores at week 12 between the study groups using linear mixed (LMM) effect models of longitudinal data with QOL estimated at each time point, with random effects for cluster and subject. The use of mixed models will allow us to account for dependency among longitudinal outcomes within a cluster and within an individual and to control for demographic and clinical factors (as necessary for any imbalances in baseline variables). Each time point will be included as a fixed factor with baseline as the reference group. Lastly, we will test for Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect (HTE) based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, AML diagnosis (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory), and enrollment of caregiver using interaction terms in the mixed models (see HTE analysis plan). We will utilize a similar strategy when comparing patient-reported depression (HADS-depression), anxiety (HADS-anxiety), PTSD symptoms (PTSD-Checklist), coping (Brief COPE), symptom burden (ESAS-r), and perception of centeredness of care (PPPC) between the two groups. The mixed models also permit inclusion of patients who only provide partial longitudinal data so that all available data are contributing to the analysis.\n\n16.1.2 Aim 2\nTo assess whether primary PC is non-inferior to specialty PC for improving patient-clinician EOL communication: We will examine patient-report of discussing EOL care preferences with their clinicians using the following item: “Have you and your doctors discussed any particular wishes you have about the care you would want to receive if you were dying?” (Yes/No). Although patients will complete this measure repeatedly during the study, we will use the final assessment either prior to death or at last follow-up assessment point (whichever comes first) for this analysis. We will compare differences between study groups in the rate of patients reporting “Yes” to this item using a binomial generalized linear mixed effects model with an identity link function, adjusting for any demographic and clinical factors that are imbalanced between the two groups (non-inferiority margin of 13%) and a single random effect for cluster. Utilizing a similar statistical approach, we will conduct an exploratory analysis comparing patient and caregiver prognostic understanding using the response to the following item of the PTPQ: “What is the likelihood that you will be cured of your leukemia?” Responses will be dichotomized as accurate versus inaccurate as done in prior studies. Although patients and caregivers will complete this measure repeatedly during the study, we will also use the final assessment either prior to death or at 24 weeks (whichever comes first) for this analysis.\n\n16.1.3 Aim 3\nTo compare the effect of primary PC versus specialty PC on EOL outcomes for patients with AML: We will compare chemotherapy use (yes/no; non-inferiority margin 15%) using a binomial generalized linear mixed effects model with an identity link function, adjusting for any demographic and clinical factors that are imbalanced between the two groups. We will also explore differences in hospitalizations (yes/no), ICU admissions (yes/no), and hospice utilization (yes/no) in the last 30 days of life between the two study groups using mixed effect logistic regression models. We will explore differences in hospice length-of-stay between primary PC and specialty PC using linear mixed effects models adjusting for imbalances between the two groups.\n\n16.1.4 Aim 4\nTo compare the effect of primary PC versus specialty PC on caregiver QOL and psychological distress: We will assess the non-inferiority of primary PC versus specialty PC on caregiver QOL (CarGOQOL, non-inferiority margin 5 points), depression (HADS-Depression, non-inferiority margin 1.5 points), anxiety (HADS-anxiety, non-inferiority margin 1.5 point) symptoms at week-12 using linear mixed effects models. We will also utilize mixed models when differences between groups in these outcomes at multiple time points (i.e., baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24).\n\n16.1.5 Aim 5\nQualitative analyses based on RE-AIM Quest: Trained study staff will conduct audio-recorded qualitative interviews with patients, caregivers, oncology and PC clinicians, and hospital leaders. Data analyses will co-occur with interview data collection to ascertain if thematic saturation (the point at which no new data are generated) has been achieved for each stratum (i.e., small, medium, or large leukemia programs). All interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo 12 qualitative software. Two independent coders will analyze the interview content thematically, overseen by Dr. Park. Guided by RE-AIM, the coders will meet to develop the thematic framework and coding plan. Each interview will be coded twice. Interpretation and analysis of coded transcripts will follow the RE-AIM framework: 1) reach, 2) effectiveness, 3) adoption, 4) implementation, and 5) maintenance. To ensure coding reliability, coding discrepancies will be resolved through discussion and comparison of raw data. Coding will continue until a high level of reliability (kappa > 0.80) is established. Individual interview results will be analyzed by strata comparisons. After the dataset is complete, the study team will conduct independent expert reviews of the data prior to integration with quantitative data."

The PC domains addressed with both interventions are identical and based on our prior studies (Table 3). While the PC domains in both interventions are the same, the approach by which clinicians utilize the strategies will differ based on clinician specialty (i.e., oncology versus PC).\n\n18.3.1 Specialty PC Intervention\nAll participating specialty PC clinicians will undergo training to ensure that the provision of services is consistent across study sites.. Prior to attending the training, the lead PC clinicians will review the specialty PC intervention guide. The lead PC clinicians will then train all participating PC clinicians at their site using the same training approach. Prior to the study start, all participating PC clinicians will review the specialty PC intervention guide, attend the site specialty PC training, and read required papers on the specialty PC model. Upon completion, trainees will complete a formal, post-training skills assessment (Section 9.3: Fidelity of study design, method, and intervention). Lead specialty PC clinicians will also be responsible for training any new clinicians at their sites using the same training approach. We will also conduct refresher trainings every six weeks during the first year of participant enrollment and then every 12 weeks thereafter with specialty PC clinicians.. PC clinicians will also document patient encounters in the electronic health record (EHR) of their respective institutions using a study specific template and complete a weekly electronic survey via REDCap to note the topics addressed during the visits for hospitalized patients and whether the caregiver was present.\nSites randomized to specialty PC will have their PC clinicians (physician or advance practice provider) see patients within three business days of enrollment. The PC clinicians will follow patients throughout their hospitalization for chemotherapy, seeing them at least twice per week. Patients and PC clinicians will be permitted to initiate additional visits as needed. PC clinicians will also follow patients during subsequent hospitalizations until death (or end of study period for those who are alive), with a minimum of two visits per week. Outpatient PC visits are not required. Although specialty PC is practiced by multidisciplinary clinicians, most inpatient practices are staffed predominantly by physicians and advanced practice providers. Study PC clinicians may involve additional clinicians (e.g., social workers, pastoral care) in the patient’s care, but these visits will not replace the required twice weekly intervention visits.\n\n18.3.2 Primary PC Comparator\nWe will conduct a half-day in-person training at each site randomized to primary PC (or over video due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The MGH investigative team will lead the training sessions at each site in collaboration with the sites’ specialty PC clinicians. We will ask oncology clinicians to review the primary PC intervention guide prior to attending the training. During the training, the oncology clinicians will have the opportunity to practice new skills and receive feedback in a supportive environment. Upon completion, trainees will complete a formal, post-training skills assessment (Section 19.1). We will also video record the training to ensure it is available for oncology clinicians who miss the initial training session. We expect the leukemia practices at each site will have staff turnover and new hires, thus the training will be made available on an annual basis (over video) throughout the study period. We will also conduct refresher trainings every six weeks during the first year of participant enrollment and then every 12 weeks thereafter with the leukemia clinicians.\nPrior to the study start, all participating oncology clinicians will review the intervention guide, attend the primary PC training, and read several papers highlighting the PC needs of patients with AML and their caregivers. We will also ask oncology clinicians to document the PC domains addressed during patient encounters in the EHR using a study specific template. Oncology clinicians will also complete a weekly electronic survey through REDCap for hospitalized patients to note the PC topics addressed and whether the caregiver was present for clinical encounters.\n\n18.3.3 Table3\n\nCodeknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/F30_table3.png\", dpi = 100)"

We chose non-inferiority margins below the threshold of what is considered a clinically significant based on the differences seen in our prior specialty PC trials. The primary endpoint of this study is to establish that primary PC is non-inferior to specialty PC in patient-reported QOL at week 12. As noted in table Table 1, in our prior study of specialty PC versus usual care in patients with AML, we found clinically and statistically significant differences between study groups at week-2 that persisted at week-12. Thus, we have chosen to power our study at week-12, which will enable us to conduct a longitudinal analysis examining the effect of the intervention over the first 12 weeks. In our prior study, we observed an 11-point difference in QOL between the two groups at week-12, favoring the specialty PC group. Thus, we chose a conservative non-inferiority margin of five points (less than 50% of the previously observed difference with specialty PC) which does not reach the threshold for clinically meaningful difference in QOL (six-point difference in FACT-Leukemia). With each of the 20 sites enrolling approximately 57-58 patients (total N=1150 patients), we will have >90% power to establish the non-inferiority of primary PC compared to specialty PC with a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of five points (assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.03 and missing data rate of 20% at week 12). Notably, in our prior multi-site trial, the rate of missing data at week 12 was only 14%. Please note, we will be using a one-sided alpha of 0.025 for this proposed non-inferiority trial.\n\nCodeknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/F33_table6.png\")\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in a recent cluster randomized trial of primary PC for patients with advanced cancer, the estimated ICC was 0.03. However, we chose to be conservative in accounting for missing data and our ICC to ensure adequate power.\nSample size calculation or justification (either provided in full or summarized, with link to original source)"

Non-English assessments will not be administered via email as this is not possible with REDCap.\n\n23.1.2 Data Obtained from EHR\nIn addition to collecting EOL care data from the EHR, we will also collect baseline clinical, disease, and treatment information including: ECOG performance status, clinical comorbidities (Sorror Comorbidity Index (Sorror and Appelbaum 2013)), AML type, date of diagnosis, and disease risk (Disease Risk Index (Armand et al. 2014), cytogenetics, and mutations). We will collect data on AML recurrence and additional treatments, including stem cell transplantation.\n\n23.1.3 Data on Addressing PC Domains\nAll participating clinicians will complete a brief REDCap survey weekly during study patient’s hospitalizations. This survey assesses PC domains and strategies addressed during clinical encounters. The survey is intentionally brief and takes approximately two minutes to complete to reduce burden on busy clinicians. In our prior studies, clinicians completed 100% of these weekly surveys. We will use the identical study procedures to ensure documentation of the PC domains addressed in the proposed trial. Specifically, prior to the study start, all participating PC will be trained on the use of the REDCap survey and the importance of entering these data. The site CRC will send a secure email with a link to the REDCap system on weekly basis. If clinicians do not complete the REDCap entry within 48 hours, they will receive a reminder email copied to the site PI.\n\n23.1.4 Data Collection Based on RE-AIM Quest Framework\nWe will utilize the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) QuEST (Qualitative Evaluation for Systematic Translation) framework to systematically to assess key dimensions of intervention implementation to enable future dissemination in real-world clinical settings. We will audio record the monthly video conferences with participating sites and create a log describing the barriers and facilitators for primary and specialty PC implementation and adoption and use this log to develop the semi-structured interview guides for the qualitative interviews with key informants. Due to the potential impact of the size of the leukemia program on challenges pertaining to implementation and adoption, we will conduct qualitative interviews stratified by the size of the leukemia program at participating sites. For each key informant group, we will interview 30 individuals, including 10 from each size stratum (small, medium, or large leukemia program). Specifically, we will conduct interviews with: - 1) patients with AML receiving specialty PC and caregivers; - 2) patients with AML receiving primary PC and caregivers; - 3) oncology clinicians; - 4) PC clinicians; - 5) hospital leaders to identify facilitators and barriers to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of primary PC and specialty PC.\nWe will collect the following data: - Reach: We will assess: - 1) the number of eligible patients and caregivers who were approached about the study; - 2) number of patients enrolled, and characteristics of refusers and enrollees; - 3) reason for refusal. We will also utilize the qualitative interviews with patients, caregivers, oncology and PC clinicians to assess recruitment and retention facilitators and barriers and discuss how they can be addressed.\n\nEffectiveness: We will evaluate effectiveness based on the comparative effectiveness of primary PC versus specialty PC on participant-reported outcomes. Additionally, we will analyze qualitative interviews of patients, caregivers, oncology and PC clinicians about the acceptability and perceived effective features of primary PC and specialty PC.\nAdoption: To examine adoption, we will assess oncology and PC clinician participation rates (i.e., % of eligible clinicians completing training requirements for specialty and primary PC). We will also quantitatively summarize proportion of oncology and PC clinicians completing the visit note template and REDCap surveys. We will solicit feedback during our qualitative interviews with oncology and PC clinicians, as well as hospital leaders related to primary PC and specialty PC implementation logistics and barriers to integration of these care models into clinical practice. In qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers, we will focus on individual factors that may have affected their participation and their desire to engage with primary or specialty PC to address their needs.\nImplementation: We will assess implementation based on fidelity to the protocol and intervention delivery (see Fidelity of Study Design, Methods, and Intervention). We will review and quantitatively summarize data on documentation of PC domains addressed during clinical encounters using the EHR. We will also review the REDCap surveys from participating clinicians longitudinally to assess changes in the patterns of PC domains addressed throughout the project period. We will also explore contamination, as noted previously, by recording patients’ use of specialty PC services in sites randomized to primary PC. In qualitative interviews with patients, caregivers, oncology and PC clinicians, we will assess overall satisfaction with the specialty and primary PC interventions and focus on ideas for intervention modification and adaptation to maximize implementation into practice.\nMaintenance: We will assess the comparative effectiveness of specialty PC versus primary PC on EOL care delivery to assess maintenance of intervention effects at the EOL. During qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers, we will explore whether modification to the specialty and primary PC interventions are needed. With the oncology and PC clinicians, as well as hospital leaders, we will explore barriers and facilitators to the specialty and primary PC maintenance and integration into standard oncology practice. Throughout the study, we will also utilize our Dissemination and Implementation stakeholder group meetings on bi-annual basis to discuss barriers and facilitators for primary and specialty PC sustainability (see Section H Engagement Approach)"

    "text": "23.3 Data Management\n\n23.3.1 Data Storage\nAll participant information and study source documents will remain confidential and be scanned and stored on secure institutional computers and in REDCap. Data abstracted from the EHR in Section 5.4.2 will be maintained in REDCap. REDCap is a free, secure, HIPAA-compliant web-based application hosted by the Partners HealthCare Research Computing, Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a consortium of academic and non-profit institutional partners, has developed this software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical study data. Data collection projects rely on a study-specific data dictionary defined by members of the study staff with planning assistance from the Data Coordinating Center (DCC).\n\n\nSee ?sec-sample_size for Sample Size and Power calculations.\n\n23.3.2 Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and Data Quality Checks\nThe DCC will lead the design and implementation of the statistics, informatics, and data management systems for the study. The DCC will work with the investigative team to develop, implement, and maintain systems for a central data repository. The DCC will be responsible for data cleaning and manipulation, generating monthly data collection and intervention fidelity reports, and providing necessary data for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DCC will be responsible for the following:\n\nMulti-site data repository: The data repository will contain all raw data from participating sites. The raw data will be organized into the master datasets that is ready for analysis based on established data standards and SDEs.\nMonthly quality reports: The monthly quality reports will include the key study-specific metrics that will track essential progress measures such as enrollment, data quality, and adherence to the primary and specialty PC interventions.\nDocument library: All data collection protocols, policies, and procedures will be organized in a password-protected searchable online library for use by study personnel to assure the integrity of data collection procedures.\nSoftware and results library: All computer code that is used to construct datasets and analyses will be archived with version control so that all analyses and reports can be exactly duplicated at any time.\nTraining materials and resources: Training procedures and manuals will be developed for all data collection procedures based on the corresponding data collection protocols.\n\n\n23.3.2.1 REDCap\nThe DCC Informatics systems will be programmed and maintained by the DCC using REDCap. The REDCap database will be managed centrally in the DCC and will be accessible via the internet at remote sites. The DCC will utilize REDCap to generate the monthly data collection and intervention fidelity reports under the supervision of the DCC investigative team. They will also prepare specialized quality control reports as needed.\n\n23.3.2.2 Pre-Specification of Research Projects\nAll publications or ancillary studies will be pre-planned in collaboration with the DCC. The DCC will evaluate the feasibility of proposed studies and will assist in development of statistical analysis plans.\n\n23.3.3 Data Monitoring\nThe DCC will assure data completeness, adherence to study protocols, and timelines by providing monthly quality reports for site PIs and the MGH investigative team. These monthly reports will include the key metrics including enrollment, data quality (i.e., missing data rates), and adherence to the primary and specialty PC interventions. The content of these monthly reports will be used by the study team to identify and correct problems as they occur. All study data will be collected through a REDCap central data repository at the University of Colorado. Data will be exported directly to a server behind the firewall for cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. Only the DCC team will have access to the data during the study. The DCC will generate the required data reports for the DSMB.\n\n23.3.4 Data Security\nParticipant data will be collected at each participating institution using REDCap. Each site will maintain their own separate list of patient names and study IDs, which will be saved in password-protected files. Participants will be identified on study forms by case number only to protect confidentiality. Identifiers such as name will only be used during the initial data retrieval process and can be destroyed once all data records have been obtained and data analysis has been completed as discussed previously.\nParticipants’ responses to survey questions will remain confidential. In addition, as stated previously, all study staff at all participating sites will undergo an extensive training on study procedure as well as data management to ensure data security and maintaining of confidentiality."

The investigative team will review missing data rates for all participating sites to address any discrepancies in missing data compared to prior studies and to ensure rigorous retention and follow-up procedures. We will use the ITT principle with all randomized subjects, conducting sensitivity analyses to explore how various assumptions about missing data and differences between completers and non-completers affect the estimated outcomes. We will include all available data for analysis of primary and secondary outcomes. Some patients may have missing covariate or outcomes data. Zhao and Ding showed that greater precision and efficiency can be achieved by using a single imputation (such as mean imputation) plus a missing variable indicator for each missing covariate in regression models for analysis of randomized trials, even when data are missing not at random (MNAR). We will use this approach for inclusion of covariates in all mixed models. Missing outcome data will not be imputed in the primary analysis; however, patients can contribute any number of time points in the mixed regression model (i.e., completion of all time points is not required) and the maximum likelihood–based estimates are valid if data are missing at random. Additional sensitivity analyses may also be conducted in handling missing data (e.g., employing pattern mixture modeling or joint modeling approaches), under the direction of the DCC."

Current cancer care models do not attend to or address these immense unmet PC care needs, which causes suffering for patients and their caregivers. While specialty PC has been shown to improve the outcomes and experience for patients with cancer, including AML, it will not be a feasible or widely adopted care model unless we demonstrate that it is the optimal way to support patients and their caregivers. The results of this study will definitively demonstrate whether primary PC is an effective alternative care model to specialty PC and provide the necessary data for health care settings to implement these care models.

This includes treatment retention rates and reasons for dropout.\nRecruitment reports: The DCC will generate recruitment and retention reports that will be made available to the DSMB committee\nData Repository: The DCC will generate data collection and management reports (including rate of missing date) that will be made available to the DSMB committee.\nSerious Adverse Events: Given that this is a supportive care study in a population at risk for disease progression and death due to their medical condition (unrelated to the study procedures), we do not expect any SAEs to be related to the study. Thus, SAEs will not be reported to the DSMB, unless they are potentially related to study procedures.\nNon-Serious Adverse Events: At yearly intervals during the course of the study and then again at its completion, the DSMB will be provided with unblinded summaries of the numbers and rates of adverse events by treatment group. These reports will include types of events, severity, and treatment phase.\nStudy Stopping Rules: If at any time during the course of the study, the committee judges that risk to subjects outweighs the potential benefits, the committee shall have the discretion and responsibility to recommend that the study be terminated. We do not, however, have a pre-specified stopping rule.\nProcedures to ensure confidentiality, preparation of reports, minutes, and recommendations: The DCC will prepare study reports and circulate them to the DSMB members at least two weeks before each regularly scheduled DSMB meeting. These reports will include overall study progress and safety data. A study team member will draft minutes of the DSMB meetings, working closely with the DSMB chair. Minutes will be circulated only to DSMB members for editing and final approval. At the conclusion of each DSMB meeting, the members will determine whether any changes in the conduct of the trial are recommended. In case of difference of opinion, majority vote will determine the DSMB recommendations. The DSMB chair will forward these recommendations to the MGH investigative team within two weeks of the DSMB meeting.

    "text": "28.1 Tests for Heterogeneity\nWe will analyze HTE by testing for interaction effects between the two groups and the following variables: patient age (> 65 vs. < 65), gender (male vs. female), race/ethnicity (White vs. other; White vs. Black; White vs. Asian; Non-Hispanic white vs. Hispanic/Latino), AML diagnosis (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed/refractory AML), and enrollment of caregiver (yes vs. no). The interaction terms will be tested in the linear and logistic mixed effect models.. All HTE analyses are considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Prior studies have found that age, gender, and race can moderate the impact of specialty PC in patients with cancer. However, it remains unclear whether these factors would contribute to HTE of primary PC versus specialty PC. Lastly, since caregiver engagement may impact patient-outcomes, we will examine whether enrollment of a caregiver contributes to the HTE of specialty PC compared to primary PC. We chose to be conservative with our sample size estimate to account for HTE analyses for the primary endpoint of the study."
